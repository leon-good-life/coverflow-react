## Usage
### Using CoverFlow in your project
1. Add coverflow-react package to your project using npm.
```bash
npm install --save coverflow-react
```

2. import CoverFlow
```javascript
import CoverFlow from 'coverflow-react';
```

3. Create an array of path/URLs to the images.
```javascript
const imagesArr = [
        'img/1.jpg',
        'img/2.jpg',
        'img/3.jpg',
        'img/4.jpg',
        'img/5.jpg'
    ];
```
(If you are using create-react-app, you can put the images in 'public' directory).

4. Add CoverFlow Component to your project and pass images array.
```jsx
<CoverFlow imagesArr={imagesArr} />
```

<CoverFlow handleSelect={(index)=>{alert(index);}} imagesArr={imagesArr} />
```
* **labelsArr** - allows to add text labels at the bottom of the images, the array must be the same size of imagesArr.
* **direction** - the default is "horizontal", if passing "vertical", the CoverFlow will transform to vertical.
